# Write a program that:
# 1. Calculates age from the given data (current_year - year of birth)
# 2. Find the missing part of the code (code_2)
#     a. Find the remainder of x divided by y
#     b. Multiply the obtained result by 13
#     c. Take the square root of the result
#     d. Take the integer part of the result
# 3. Combine the code into a separate variable
#     Example:
#         475-12-967
# 4. Print the string:
#     Example:
#         Hello Mary Gold. You are 26 years old. Your secret code is 475-12-967.


# years

# 1. Calculates age from the given data (current_year - year of birth)

# 2. Find the missing part of the code (code_2)
#     a. Find the remainder of x divided by y
#     b. Multiply the obtained result by 13
#     c. Take the square root of the result
#     d. Take the integer part of the result

#     Example:
#         475-12-967

# 4. Print the string:
#     Example:
#         Hello Mary Gold. You are 26 years old. Your secret code is 475-12-967.
